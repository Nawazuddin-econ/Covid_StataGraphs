The data was taken from https://www.covid19india.org/. This platform archived all the data on 31st October 2021.
I produced the graphs during the pandemic and shared them on my various social media accounts to raise public awareness.
Before sharing them on GitHub, I recreated the graphs to check for any errors.
This do file will be good for beginners who want to make graphs in Stata. Even if you are new to Stata, the codes will familiarize you with it as well. .
