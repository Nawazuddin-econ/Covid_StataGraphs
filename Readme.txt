The data was taken from https://www.covid19india.org/. This platform archived all the data on 31st October 2021.
I produced the graphs during the pandemic and shared them on my various social media accounts to raise public awareness.
Before sharing them on GitHub, I recreated the graphs to check for any errors.
For reporting errors, providing feedback, or expressing gratitude, you can contact me at nawazuddin.econ@gmail.com.
